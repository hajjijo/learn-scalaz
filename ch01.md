# Chapter 1: Introduction
We'll start this chapter getting familiar with some basic concepts, most of them are abstract Functional Programming concepts that can be seen throughout many languages and tools (specially haskell) and many are borrowed from `Category Theory`. We'll take a quick look upon `Category Theory` in later chapters.

## TypeClass
A `TypeClass` is a tool that helps us to define a common behaviour (feature) for a variety of types. In scala, we usualy define a TypeClass as a generic trait :
```SCALA
trait StringMaker[T] {
  def makeString(t: T): String
}
```
Now we can define an instance of `StringMaker` for any type we want and use the instances wherever we need.
In this example, `StringMake` is a __TypeClass__, defined on type `T` and knows how to turn `t`s into strings. In anthor words, an instance of `StringMaker[X]` adds `makeString` behaviour to `x`s.
For example if we want to have an instance of `StringMaker[Int]` we can defined it as :
```SCALA
val intStringMaker = new StringMaker[Int]{ 
  def makeString(t: Int): String = t.toString 
} 
```
At this point,you may say to yourself that `StringMaker` and `TypeClasses` are nothing but useless! And you're right since Scala has it's built-in `toString` defined in almost every object. But read on and you'll see the magic.

Next, we'll explore some simple example of `TypeClass`es to understand the concept better.

### Equal
Lets create a TypeClass called `Equal` that does one thing only; checking for equality :
```SCALA
trait Equal[T] {
  def eq(left: T, right: T) : Boolean
}
```
Simple, right ? An instance of `Equal[X]` knows how to compare two instances of `X` together and tell whether they are equal.
```
Exercise 1.1: Try to write instances of Equal for a couple of simple types like Int and String and then for a case class like Person

### Order
Now try to write another TypeClass for object comparision. This one is called `Order`, an instance of `Order` can not only tell us whether two object are the same, it can tell which one is greater or less than other. We'll 
```
Exercise 1.2: Define TypeClass Order[T] that has these features : 'gt' to check that left is greater than right, 'eq' to check that left and right are equal, 'gte' to check that left is greater or equal to right. Also define 'lt' and 'lte' alike.
Note: How can we use 'Equal' type class that we've defined before?
Also try to play around with 'Order' and make a few instances for it.
```

### JsonParser
Now it's easy to design a simple TypeClass for parsing json values. For now we're just interested in the TypeClass it self, not implementations.
```
Exercise 1.3: Design the TypeClass 'JsonParser' that provides two functionalities: 
1. A function that converts an instance of our desired type to it's corresponding json value (output type would be String)
2. A function that does exact opposite of the previous function: form a String to our desired type
```

## TypeClass instances
By now we have a basic understanding of what a TypeClass is. And also we've seen some TypeClass `instance`s. An `instance` of a TypeClass is the impementation of that TypeClass for a specific type. A TypeClass only defines behaviour and we have to implement the behaviour for all our intended types. 

So if we want to use a TypeClass on a given type, we need a TypeClass instance for that type, which means we need to implement lots and lots of instances of various TypeClasses for our types, which which may cumbersome. But in reality it isn't that hard, because : First, Scalaz includes lots of TypeClasses and lots of TypeClass instances for common types. Second: One of the main characteristics of Functional Programming is compositionality, which enables us to mix existing TypeClasses or TypeClass instances and invent new ones.

## TypeClass syntax
So let's get back to using TypeClasses. Imagine that we need to use the `Order` TypeClass that we've defined in exercise 1.2 to compare people by their age.
